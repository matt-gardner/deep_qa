"""
A ``Field`` is some piece of a data instance that ends up as an array in a model (either as an
input or an output).  Data instances are just collections of fields.


Fields go through up to two steps of processing: (1) tokenized fields are converted into token ids,
(2) fields containing token ids (or any other numeric data) are padded (if necessary) and converted
into data arrays.  We have two ``Field`` objects corresponding to fields in each stage of this
processing pipeline: ``UnindexedFields`` are fields containing raw strings (already tokenized) that
need to be converted into token IDs.  We use these fields to compute a vocabulary, then convert
them to ``IndexedFields``.  ``IndexedFields`` have a method for determining padding lengths, so
that a data generator object can intelligently batch together instances, then pad them.

If you are writing a new ``Field`` class, if there is nothing in the field that needs to be
converted from strings to integers, you should just subclass ``IndexedField``.  If you `do` need to
convert strings to integers, you should subclass both ``IndexedField`` and ``UnindexedField``, and
make the ``UnindexedField`` subclass public, and the other private.
